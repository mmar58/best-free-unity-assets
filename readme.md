### [Mirror](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/network/mirror-129321)
#### Description
It's a very easy asset for making multiplayer games on networok based asset. You can use it for making lan games and also online multiplayer games. For online multiplayer, you have to buy a server to run unity instance but for lan multiplayer, you can just start server/host in one of your device. It's a nice and easy to use asset.
